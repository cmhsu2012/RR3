#This is the Sage program for the Small Eisenstein congruences and explicit non-Gorenstein R=T project. Please find below a list of descriptions for the files in this program. 

1. RR3_main_program: This is the main program file that should be executed in Sage. You choose your ell_1 value in this file.

2. RR3_initial_setup: This implements the algorithms in Section 3.1.

3. RR3_functions: This implements the functions used throughout Sections 3.2 to 3.5.

4. RR3_Kolyvagin_setup: This implements the algorithms in Section 3.2.

5. RR3_a1_side: This implements the algorithms in Section 3.3.

6. RR3_b2_side: This implements the algorithms in Section 3.4 and 3.5.
